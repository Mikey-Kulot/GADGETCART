                <strong>Intel Core i9 13900KS Processor (BX8071513900KS)</strong>

                <p class="prod-desc">The new 13th Gen "Raptor Lake" silicon top dog, the Core i9-13900KS, is arguably Intel's fastest consumer-oriented processor (CPU) ever created. 
                    But that doesn't necessarily make it the best. In an incredible feat of engineering, 
                    Intel designed this processor with a total of 24 cores and a top clock speed of 6GHz, a clock so high that it once seemed unattainable outside of exotic overclocking demos. 
                    This number is unquestionably impressive, but as it stands, this is a processor that's hard to recommend at such a high price. 
                    This isn't because its performance is poor or because it has a fatal flaw, but instead because the 
                    Core i9-13900K exists at a price and delivers near-identical performance in most real-world use cases.

                    <p>The Intel Core i9-13900KS is a desktop processor with 24 cores, launched in January 2023. It is part of the Core i9 lineup, using the Raptor Lake architecture with Socket 1700. Intel Hyper-Threading technology is available and effectly doubles the core-count of the P-Cores, to a total of 32 threads. Core i9-13900KS has 36 MB of L3 cache and operates at 3.2 GHz by default, but can boost up to 6 GHz, depending on the workload. Intel is making the Core i9-13900KS on a 10 nm production node, the transistor count is unknown. You may freely adjust the unlocked multiplier on Core i9-13900KS, which simplifies overclocking greatly, as you can easily dial in any overclocking frequency.
                        With a TDP of 150 W, the Core i9-13900KS is extremely power hungry, which means you need top-notch cooling. Intel's processor supports DDR4 and DDR5 memory with a dual-channel interface. ECC memory is supported, too, which is an important capability for mission-critical systems, to avoid data corruption. For communication with other components in the system, Core i9-13900KS uses a PCI-Express Gen 5 connection. This processor features the UHD Graphics 770 integrated graphics solution.
                        Hardware virtualization is available on the Core i9-13900KS, which greatly improves virtual machine performance. Additionally, IOMMU virtualization (PCI passthrough) is supported, so that guest virtual machines may directly use host hardware. Programs using Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) can run on this processor, boosting performance for calculation-heavy applications. Besides AVX, Intel is including the newer AVX2 standard, too, but not AVX-512.</p>
